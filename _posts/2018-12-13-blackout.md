## Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 blackout



The Call of Duty series is extremely big but one thing they recently added with the released of Call of Duty black ops 4 is blackout. Blackout is a battle royal mode in first person that is has good graphics and is fun to play with friends since I play backout myself. The inventory is easy to use and there are no bugs with the guns. The vehicles are alright since they are used to run people over.
